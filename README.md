> Effects of Different Strategies for Exploiting Genomic Selection in Perennial Ryegrass Breeding Programs


### Simulation outline
The simulation study consisted of the following main steps: 
- Simulation of ryegrass base population and initial ryegrass varieties.
- Simulation of conventional breeding and GS schemes in various scenarios.


### Simulation of the base population and initial varieties
The [QMSim](http://animalbiosciences.uoguelph.ca/~msargol/qmsim/) software (Sargolzaei and Schenkel 2009) was used to simulate a historical population.
